- Limitations and bugs

- okay so when recording video on the click of the mute button the recording stops and restarts again
- same thing happens on the camera facing props too. its not like that for flash and torch tho.
- i want to use react-native-camera-vision later on. so i can even do ai processing on the payload before sending it over to server to reduce workload on my server.
